            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a collaborative tool that acts as a main repository for all files in a project. It allows members of the project to look at files, make changes to the files, and commit the new files they've created by changing the original. Version control automatically keeps track of who changes the files, when they were changed, the differences between the old and new file, and merge said differences onto the same file. This means that files can't be overwritten, people can work on the same files simultaneously, and can even revert back to older versions of files since every file is backed up.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository where developers record the history of file changes and track their statuses/versions. There are two types of repositories: remote and local. A remote repository stores files on a remote server and is shared among all the members of the team/organization. A local repository stores files on a local machine of an individual. There are two ways to create a local repository. You either have ti create a brand new repository, or clone an already existing repository onto your local machine.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As advertised on Git's website, "Git is a free and open source distributed control system to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency." What does a distributed version control system do? It allows every user to have a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine, allowing them to work offline as well. There isn't a single point of failure, making it very secure and efficient. Git also prevents unintentional overwrites of files stored on the shared repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has several kinds of commands. One kind would be basic commands: git init, git add --all, or git log. Another type of commands would be remote commands: git remote, git pull, and git push. Remote commands are use to manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track. If you want to start a new repository or obtain one from an existing URL, you would type $ git init [project-name].</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before Git, Linux would update its kernel and software changes through patches as archived files. Then in 2002, Linux kernel project used a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper, which worked for about 3 years until BitKeeper was no longer free-of-charge, breaking down the community that developed around it. This prompted them to develop their own free tool similar to BitKeeper but with the goals of making the new system faster, simpler, fully distributed, better support, and able to handle large projects with ease. This is how Git was born.</p>
